<h2>My Top 4 Movies & Shows</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter Movies</h3>
<p>Every single one of these movies holds a special place in my heart because it reminds me of childhood and how excited I was to go watch them at the movies with friends and family. If you are a believer in magic and wonder, these movies are the perfect recommendation.</p>
<h3>Flipped</h3>
<p>The first time I watched this movie, I was on a plane for the first time! What I love the most about this movie is that it makes me laugh and cry. It is full with funny moment as well as moments that will make you think about life in a deep level. I think it's really cool that the story is told based on two points of view.</p>
<h3>How I Met Your Mother</h3>
<p>This 9 season show is hilarious. It goes deept into the lives of 5 friends, especially the main character, Ted Mosby, and his quest to find love.</p>
<h3>I Think You Should Leave by Tim Robinson</h3>
<p>There are 3 seasons of this show. Every episode is comprised by about 5 or so sketches. It is incredibly cringey and definitely not the type of humor that everyone would understand. It took me 2 full watches before I could appreciate the genius behind these sketches. Of course, there are some better than others, but overall this show makes fun of so many things like beauty pageants, office jokes, awkward people, etc. Definitely watch it when you're in the mood for something funny.</p>
