<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Michelle Ranalli. I was born and raised in Mexico. I am Mexican from my mother's side and Italian from my father's side. I came to America when I was eighteen years old, and enrolled in an adult school to learn English. After graduating in a year, I went to East Los Angeles College, then transferred to Azusa Pacific University. I currently hold a BM in Music Performance from Azusa Pacific University- Summa Cum Laude December 2018.</p>
<p> I have worked a myriad of jobs that range from music instructor to flight attendant. For the past five months I have been trying to learn how to code, but unfortunately I bought a bootcamp that was not very helpful. Months later I saw that the bootcamp by Dr Angela Yu was on sale, and I decided to start all over. This has been the best decision I have ever made, for it made me learn everything in a much deeper level and actually understand what I was doing. I am hoping to make this skill my new career. I am passionate about learning technology, and I am proud of myself for achieving this dream.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite hobbies are playing board games and video games. My favorite board games are <a href="http://www.foursouls.com">The Binding of Isaac Four Souls</a>, which is based on one of my favorite video games, <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/store/products/the-binding-of-isaac-afterbirth-plus-switch/">The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth +</a>. My other favorite video game is <a href="http://www.hogwartslegacy.com/en-us">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. I also like singing, hanging out with my family and friends, and watching tv. I am currently watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suits_(American_TV_series)">Suits</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)">The Walking Dead</a> on Netflix. I just finished watching both seasons of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Father">How I Met Your Father</a> on Hulu. Additionally, I am a huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)">Harry Potter</a> fan and watch the movies every night.</p>
